# Arturia "pigments" presets

I bought [Arturia](https://www.arturia.com)'s [Pigments](https://www.arturia.com/products/analog-classics/pigments) because the demo has a 20 minute time limit and doesn't let you save, and by the time I hit the demo limit for the 10th time, I figured it was time to just pay for it.

And since the presets are all text based, guess what you can super easily do?

Correct: revision control and packaged releases. So hey, let's put my presets up on github and we'll see how long that lasts!
